# ReScript Snake game

This is the code made during [Building a game with ReScript & KAPLAY](https://youtu.be/iVcMILQplL0).

## Running locally

```shell
# Install all dependencies
bun install

# Run the ReScript compiler
bunx rescript -w

# (In another shell)
# Run a dev server
bunx vite
```
## KAPLAY bindings

Feel free to copy [src/Kaplay.res](./src/Kaplay.res) into your own project.
If there is enough interest I can publish an npm package for this.
